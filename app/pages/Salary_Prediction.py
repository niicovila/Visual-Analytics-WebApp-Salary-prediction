st.write("Linear Regression is a straightforward and interpretable choice for predicting salaries, particularly suitable when the relationship between predictors and salary is linear. However, it might struggle to capture more intricate patterns, which seems to be our case. Random Forest, known for handling non-linear relationships well, is robust to overfitting and can adapt to unbalanced datasets. Gradient Boosting Regressor, offering high predictive accuracy, can also handle unbalanced datasets but requires careful tuning to prevent overfitting. Feed Forward Neural Networks, powerful for complex patterns, may be suitable for larger datasets but demand meticulous parameter tuning. In simpler cases, it might not perform well. LightGBM, efficient and scalable, stands out for unbalanced datasets due to its ability to handle skewed distributions effectively, making it a favorable choice for predicting salaries with varying class frequencies. The selection among these models hinges on factors like dataset characteristics, interpretability, and computational considerations.")
